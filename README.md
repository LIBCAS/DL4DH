DL4DH – development of tools for effective utilization and mining of data from digital libraries to reinforce digital humanities research

Almost every single central or large library stores a big amount of data in a digital form. The data are usually described by the high-quality metadata, which enables to browse these collections, to create various virtual exhibitions etc. They are stored in digital libraries or different repositories, whose design and basic functionalities are primarily intended just for the content viewing. To increase the level of their usability for the special research group of the data scientists is needed to enrich the metadata content and to develop the appropriate interfaces to extract the data to make the heuristic part of the research more effective than today. 

The aim of the project is to design a set of the new functionalities and independent tools that enables the extensive data mining procedures in digital libraries to cover the digital humanities researchers needs.
